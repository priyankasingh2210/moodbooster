This app tells about 5 Ways To Boost Your Mood &amp; Live A Happier Life. We all have days where we feel grumpy or a little blue. The next time youâ€™re having an off day or need a little pick-me-up, here are some of my favourite evidence-based ways to get that bounce back in your step.

On First screen you will see these 5 options for boosting your mood in a list, on clicking on them app will navigate to a detailed page.
Detail page shows an image and description about the thought. 
If you like the thought you can share it on all available social ways to others using share button on the screen.
To see next thought you have to come back to main page where all ideas are listed and select the other thought.
